"""Phase 2: insert the sharing protocol into plans generated without it.

Phase 1 writes an ordinary sequential plan -- which the model does reliably --
and this computes where the two agents contend, with the whole plan in hand.
That is the part the model could not do while writing: four ordered obligations
spanning both agents and often ten steps. Four prompt-side approaches were tried
and all landed at 0-18%.

Contention is exactly two things:
  * the same OBJECT used by both agents;
  * the same EXCLUSIVE fixture (one opening, or too small for two robots).
A roomy counter shared by two agents on different objects is not contention.

For each one, three symbolically inert steps go in immediately before the
dependent action, so nothing downstream shifts in meaning:

    communicate(B -> A, "... <X> ...")     announcement: under partial
                                           observability the wait is invisible
                                           to A, so without this nobody knows
                                           to release it
    wait_for_signal(from=A, about=X)       B blocks
    communicate(A -> B, "... <X> ...")     release; A has already finished with
                                           X earlier in the recorded order

Nothing with world-state effects is inserted. `give_space` is never added: for a
fixture the releasing act is simply that A moved on, which the plan already has.

Deadlock is checked, not assumed: inserted waits can form a cycle (B waits on A
while A waits on B), which the FSM cannot see and which hangs live-sim. The
check replays the per-agent streams the way the scheduler does and fails loudly
if both agents end up blocked.
