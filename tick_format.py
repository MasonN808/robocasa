"""Tick-based trajectory format: the plan written the way it executes.

The flat step list is a *serialization* of two independent per-agent streams.
Reading it top to bottom gives one interleaving, but that is an artifact of how
the JSON was written, not a constraint on anything -- the agents advance at
their own rates, so position in the list says nothing about when a step runs.
Every coordination defect measured on this dataset traces to that one gap:

    2 of 2   lock-step collisions   (plan alternates correctly, ticks collide)
  332 of 357 inert waits            (release is later in the file, earlier in time)

In tick form there is no gap to fall into. Each row is one instant; both agents
act on it simultaneously; a blocked agent is visibly blocked. The model writes
in the frame the simulator executes in, so it can see that it is about to be
held up -- which is what it needs in order to say "tell me when the machine is
free" rather than "heading over now" and then wait.

    rows  -> steps : `to_steps`, for the FSM and everything downstream
    steps -> rows  : `to_rows`, for prompting and for inspection
