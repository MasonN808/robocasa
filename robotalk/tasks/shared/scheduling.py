Both need the same answer to "when does this step actually run", and when they
each had their own answer they drifted: the inserter reasoned about positions
in the file while the executor advanced two agents independently. Everything
downstream of that gap -- collisions, inert waits, deadlocks -- came from one
of them being wrong. There is one implementation here so that cannot recur.
