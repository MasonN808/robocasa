"""A validator that replays a trajectory the way the executor actually runs it.

The old validator walks the flat step list top to bottom against one state. That
list is a *serialization* of two independent per-agent streams, so reading it in
order describes an interleaving that never happens: a step written at index 5 may
run long after one written at index 6. Every coordination defect measured on this
dataset traces back to that gap, and each was patched separately -- a lock-step
collision checker here, a tick-span contention rule there, a wait-necessity
heuristic in a third place. They were all approximations of one thing the
validator was not doing: running the plan.

This one runs it. Two agents, a clock, per-tool durations, and waits that block
until a release is *delivered*. Contention stops being something to infer -- if
two agents end up holding the same object or standing at the same exclusive
fixture at the same instant, the replay is simply in that state, and the check is
a state invariant rather than a guess about plan positions.

Two duration models, both faithful to a real executor regime:

    LOCK_STEP  every call costs 1.0  -- `live_sim_eval._UNIFORM_DURATIONS`
    EXECUTOR   the per-class floors  -- `live_sim_eval._tool_duration` default

LOCK_STEP is the "tick" regime: instants are integers and one instant is one
tick. EXECUTOR is what the live evaluation runs by default. A plan that is
correct only under one of them is correct only by luck, so `validate` checks
both by default; see `DURATION_MODELS`.
